A common way of displaying dictionaries is using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), for example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { \"id\" : 1 , \"name\" : \"Tim the Beaver\" , \"school\" : { \"name\" : \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" }, \"enrolled\" : true , \"classes\" : [ \"6.001\" , \"18.01\" , \"8.01\" ] } The above example shows that in JSON the keys (quoted text before the :) can map to different types of values. The allowed types are number, text, other dictionaries, booleans, and lists. In the blocks language, you can build this dictionary as follows: Create Empty Dictionary \u2693\ufe0e The create empty dictionary block creates a dictionary without any key-value pairs. Entries can be added to the empty dictionary using the set value for key block. The create empty dictionary block can also be turned into a make a dictionary block by using the blue mutator button to add pair entries. Make A Dictionary \u2693\ufe0e The make a dictionary is used to create a dictionary with a set of pairs known in advance. Additional entries can be added using set value for key. Key Value Pair \u2693\ufe0e The pair block is a special purpose block used for constructing dictionaries. Get Value For Key \u2693\ufe0e The get value for key block checks to see if the dictionary contains a corresponding value for the given key. If it does, the value is returned. Otherwise, the value of the not found parameter is returned. This behavior is similar to the behavior of the lookup in pairs block. Set Value for Key \u2693\ufe0e The set value for key block sets the corresponding value for the given key in the dictionary to value . If no mapping exists for key , a new one will be created. Otherwise, the existing value is replaced by the new value. Remove Entry For Key \u2693\ufe0e The delete entry for key block removes the key-value mapping in the dictionary for the given key. If no entry for the key exists in the dictionary, the dictionary is not modified. Get Value at Key Path \u2693\ufe0e The get value at key path block is a more advanced version of the get value for key block. Rather than getting the value of a specific key, it instead takes a list of valid keys and numbers representing a path through a data structure. The get value for key block is equivalent to using this block with a key path of length 1 containing the key. For example, the following two blocks would return \"Tim the Beaver\": It walks the data structure, starting from the initial dictionary, using the path provided in order to retrieve values nested deeply in complex data structures. It is best used for processing JSON data from web services. Starting from the initial input, it takes the first element in the key path and checks to see if a key (if the input is a dictionary) or index (if the input is a list) exists at that point. If so, it selects that item as the input and proceeds to check the next element in the key path, continuing until either the whole path has been followed, at which point it returns what is at that location, or the \"not found\" parameter. Example \u2693\ufe0e 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { \"id\" : 1 , \"name\" : \"Tim the Beaver\" , \"school\" : { \"name\" : \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" }, \"enrolled\" : true , \"classes\" : [ \"6.001\" , \"18.01\" , \"8.01\" ] } For example, given the JSON dictionary above, the following use of get value at key path will yield the result \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\". The get value at key path< allows for the path to include numbers representing the index of elements to traverse when dictionaries and lists are mixed. For example, if we wanted to know the second class that Tim was taking, we could do the following: which returns the value \"18.01\". Set Value For Key Path \u2693\ufe0e The set value for key path block updates the value at a specific key path in a data structure. It is the mirror of get value for key path, which retrieves a value at a specific key path. The path must be valid, except for the last key, which if a mapping does not exist will create a mapping to the new value. Otherwise, the existing value is replaced with the new value. Get Keys \u2693\ufe0e The get keys returns a list of keys in the dictionary. Get Values \u2693\ufe0e The get values returns a list containing the values in the dictionary. Modifying the contents of a value in the list will also modify it in the dictionary. Is Key In Dictionary? \u2693\ufe0e The is key in dictionary? tests whether the key exists in the dictionary and returns true if it does, otherwise it returns false. Size of Dictionary? \u2693\ufe0e The size of dictionary block returns the number of key-value pairs present in the dictionary. List Of Pairs To Dictionary \u2693\ufe0e The list of pairs to dictionary block converts an associative list of the form ((key1 value1) (key2 value2) ...) into a dictionary mapping the keys to their values. Because dictionaries provide better lookup performance than associative lists, if you want to perform many operations on a data structure it is advisable to use this block to convert the associative list into a dictionary first. Dictionary To List Of Pairs \u2693\ufe0e The dictionary to list of pairs converts a dictionary into an associative list. This block reverses the conversion performed by the list of pairs to dictionary block. Copy Dictionary \u2693\ufe0e The copy dictionary makes a deep copy of the given dictionary. This means that all of the values are copied recursively and that changing a value in the copy will not change it in the original. Merge Into Dictionary \u2693\ufe0e The merge into dictionary from dictionary block copies the key-value pairs from one dictionary into another, overwriting any keys in the target dictionary. List By Walking Key Path \u2693\ufe0e The list by walking key path block works similarly to the get value at key path, but creates a list of values rather than returning a single value. It works by starting at the given dictionary and walking down the tree of objects following the given path. Unlike the get value at key path though, its path can be composed of three major types: dictionary keys, list indices, and the walk all at level block. If a key or index is provided, the specific path is taken at that point in the tree. If the walk all at level is specified, every value at that point is followed in succession (breadth-first), at which point the walk continues from the next element in the path. Any element that matches the whole path is added to the output list. Example \u2693\ufe0e Consider the following JSON and blocks: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { \"people\" : [{ \"first_name\" : \"Tim\" , \"last_name\" : \"Beaver\" },{ \"first_name\" : \"John\" , \"last_name\" : \"Smith\" , },{ \"first_name\" : \"Jane\" , \"last_name\" : \"Doe\" }] } If global data contains a dictionary represented by the JSON, then the list by walking key path block will produce the list [\"Tim\", \"Beaver\"]. First, the value of the \"people\" tag, that is the list of people, is chosen. Next, the first element in the list is chosen. Lastly, the walk all at level block selects the values in the object at that point, that is, the values \"Tim\" and \"Beaver\". You can also use walk all at level at a level containing a list. For example, the following block selects the first names of all of the people in the structure, i.e., [\"Tim\", \"John\", \"Jane\"]. This block can also be used with XML parsed using the Web.XMLTextDecodeAsDictionary block. Consider the following XML document: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <schedule> <day> <room name= \"Hewlitt\" /> <room name= \"Bleil\" /> </day> <day> <room name= \"Kiva\" /> <room name= \"Star\" /> </day> </schedule> You can use the following blocks to get a list of the names of the rooms on the first day, i.e. [\"Hewlitt\", \"Bleil\"]. Walk All At Level \u2693\ufe0e The walk all at level block is a specialized block that can be used in the key path of a list by walking key path. When encountered during a walk, it causes every item at that level to be explored. For dictionaries, this means that every value is visited. For lists, each item in the list is visited. This can be used to aggregate information from a list of items in a dictionary, such as the first name of every person in a database represented by JSON objects. See the list by walking key path block for examples. Is A Dictionary? \u2693\ufe0e The is a dictionary? block tests to see whether the thing given to it is a dictionary or not. It will return true if the thing is a dictionary and false otherwise.","title":"Dictionaries"},{"location":"blocks/dictionaries/#dictionary-blocks","text":"","title":"Dictionary Blocks"},{"location":"blocks/dictionaries/#introduction","text":"Dictionaries, called in other languages terms such as maps, associative arrays or lists, are data structures that associate one value, often called the key, with another value.

It works by starting at the given dictionary and walking down the tree of objects following the given path. Unlike the get value at key path though, its path can be composed of three major types: dictionary keys, list indices, and the walk all at level block. If a key or index is provided, the specific path is taken at that point in the tree. If the walk all at level is specified, every value at that point is followed in succession (breadth-first), at which point the walk continues from the next element in the path.

First, the value of the \"people\" tag, that is the list of people, is chosen. Next, the first element in the list is chosen. Lastly, the walk all at level block selects the values in the object at that point, that is, the values \"Tim\" and \"Beaver\". You can also use walk all at level at a level containing a list. For example, the following block selects the first names of all of the people in the structure, i.e., [\"Tim\", \"John\", \"Jane\"].

Clicking the blue plus sign will allow you to add additional items to your list. Add Items To List \u2693\ufe0e Adds the given items to the end of the list. The difference between this and append to list is that append to list takes the items to be appended as a single list while add items to list takes the items as individual arguments. This block is a mutator. Is In List \u2693\ufe0e If thing is one of the elements of the list, returns true; otherwise, returns false. Note that if a list contains sublists, the members of the sublists are not themselves members of the list. For example, the members of the list (1 2 (3 4)) are 1, 2, and the list (3 4); 3 and 4 are not themselves members of the list. Length Of List \u2693\ufe0e Returns the number of items in the list.

Copy List \u2693\ufe0e Makes a copy of a list, including copying all sub-lists. Is A List? \u2693\ufe0e If thing is a list, returns true; otherwise, returns false. Reverse List \u2693\ufe0e Reverses a copy of the list with items in the reverse order. For example reverse([1,2,3]) returns [3,2,1] List To CSV Row \u2693\ufe0e Interprets the list as a row of a table and returns a CSV (comma-separated value) text representing the row. Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. Items are separated by commas. For example, converting the list (a b c d) to a CSV row produces (\u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d, \u201cc\u201d, \u201cd\u201d). The returned row text does not have a line separator at the end. List to CSV Table \u2693\ufe0e Interprets the list as a table in row-major format and returns a CSV (comma-separated value) text representing the table. Each item in the list should itself be a list representing a row of the CSV table. Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. In the returned text, items in rows are separated by commas and rows are separated by CRLF (\\r\\n). List from CSV Row \u2693\ufe0e Parses a text as a CSV (comma-separated value) formatted row to produce a list of fields. For example, converting (\u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d, \u201cc\u201d, \u201cd\u201d) to a list produces (a b c d). List from CSV Table \u2693\ufe0e Parses a text as a CSV (comma-separated value) formatted table to produce a list of rows, each of which is a list of fields. Rows can be separated by newlines (\\n) or CRLF (\\r\\n). Lookup In Pairs \u2693\ufe0e Used for looking up information in a dictionary-like structure represented as a list. This operation takes three inputs, a key, a list pairs, and a notFound result, which by default, is set to \u201cnot found\u201d. Here pairs must be a list of pairs, that is, a list where each element is itself a list of two elements. Lookup in pairs finds the first pair in the list whose first element is the key, and returns the second element. For example, if the list is ((a apple) (d dragon) (b boxcar) (cat 100)) then looking up \u2018b\u2019 will return \u2018boxcar\u2019. If there is no such pair in the list, then the lookup in pairs will return the notFound parameter. If pairs is not a list of pairs, then the operation will signal an error.

Random Set Seed To \u2693\ufe0e Use this block to generate repeatable sequences of random numbers. You can generate the same sequence of random numbers by first calling random set seed with the same value. This is useful for testing programs that involve random values. Minimum \u2693\ufe0e Returns the smallest value of a set of numbers. If there are unplugged sockets in the block, min will also consider 0 in its set of numbers. This block is a mutator and a dropdown. Maximum \u2693\ufe0e Returns the largest value of a set of numbers. If there are unplugged sockets in the block, max will also consider 0 in its set of numbers. This block is a mutator and a dropdown.

Round \u2693\ufe0e Returns the given number rounded to the closest integer. If the fractional part is < .5 it will be rounded down. It it is > .5 it will be rounded up. If it is exactly equal to .5, numbers with an even whole part will be rounded down, and numbers with an odd whole part will be rounded up. (This method is called round to even.) Ceiling \u2693\ufe0e Returns the smallest integer that\u2019s greater than or equal to the given number. Floor \u2693\ufe0e Returns the greatest integer that\u2019s less than or equal to the given number. Modulo (%) \u2693\ufe0e Modulo(a,b) is the same as remainder(a,b) when a and b are positive. More generally, modulo(a,b) is defined for any a and b so that (floor(a/b)\u00d7 b) + modulo(a,b) = a. For example, modulo(11, 5) = 1, modulo(-11, 5) = 4, modulo(11, -5) = -4, modulo(-11, -5) = -1. Modulo(a,b) always has the same sign as b, while remainder(a,b) always has the same sign as a. Remainder \u2693\ufe0e Remainder(a,b) returns the result of dividing a by b and taking the remainder. The remainder is the fractional part of the result multiplied by b. For example, remainder(11,5) = 1 because 11 / 5 = 2 1\u20445 In this case, 1\u20445 is the fractional part. We multiply this by b, in this case 5 and we get 1, our remainder. Other examples are remainder(-11, 5) = -1, remainder(11, -5) = 1, and remainder(-11, -5) = -1. Quotient \u2693\ufe0e Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second and discarding any fractional part of the result. sine \u2693\ufe0e Returns the sine of the given number in degrees. Cosine \u2693\ufe0e Returns the cosine of the given number in degrees. Tangent \u2693\ufe0e Returns the tangent of the given number in degrees. Arc Sine \u2693\ufe0e Returns the arcsine of the given number in degrees. Arc Cosine \u2693\ufe0e Returns the arccosine of the given number in degrees. Arc Tangent \u2693\ufe0e Returns the arctangent of the given number in degrees. Arc Tangent2 \u2693\ufe0e Returns the arctangent of y/x, given y and x. Convert Radians To Degrees \u2693\ufe0e Returns the value in degrees of the given number in radians. The result will be an angle in the range [0, 360) Convert Degrees To Radians \u2693\ufe0e Returns the value in radians of the given number in degrees. The result will be an angle in the range [-\u03c0 , +\u03c0) Format As Decimal \u2693\ufe0e Formats a number as a decimal with a given number of places after the decimal point. The number of places must be a non-negative integer. The result is produced by rounding the number (if there were too many places) or by adding zeros on the right (if there were too few). Is A Number? \u2693\ufe0e Returns true if the given object is a number, and false otherwise. Convert Number \u2693\ufe0e Takes a text string that represents a positive integer in one base and returns a string that represents the same number is another base. For example, if the input string is 10, then converting from base 10 to binary will produce the string 1010; while if the input string is the same 10, then converting from binary to base 10 will produce the string 2. If the input string is the same 10, then converting from base 10 to hex will produce the string A. Bitwise And \u2693\ufe0e Takes two numbers and compares each pair of bits. Each bit of the result is 1 only if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1. Bitwise Or (Inclusive) \u2693\ufe0e Takes two numbers and compares each pair of bits. Each bit of the result is 1 if either of the corresponding bits in each operand is 1. Bitwise Or (Exclusive) \u2693\ufe0e Takes two numbers and compares each pair of bits.

Checking for collisions with a rotated sprite currently checks the sprite's unrotated position so that collision checking will be inaccurate for tall narrow or short wide sprites that are rotated. Any of the sprite properties can be changed at any time under program control.

When the application is run, the VideoPlayer will be displayed as a rectangle on-screen. If the user touches the rectangle, controls will appear to play/pause, skip ahead, and skip backward within the video. The application can also control behavior by calling the Start , Pause , and SeekTo methods. Video files should be in 3GPP (.3gp) or MPEG-4 (.mp4) formats. For more details about legal formats, see Android Supported Media Formats . App Inventor for Android only permits video files under 1 MB and limits the total size of an application to 5 MB, not all of which is available for media (video, audio, and sound) files. If your media files are too large, you may get errors when packaging or installing your application, in which case you should reduce the number of media files or their sizes. Most video editing software, such as Windows Movie Maker and Apple iMovie, can help you decrease the size of videos by shortening them or re-encoding the video into a more compact format. You can also set the media source to a URL that points to a streaming video, but the URL must point to the video file itself, not to a program that plays the video.

There are differences between App Inventor and App Inventor 2, and these will be highlighted when appropriate. Background \u2693\ufe0e MIT App Inventor is a rather large system divided in multiple projects, each of which relies on different open source technologies. Before showing what each of those projects are (section 3), we introduce some of the technologies used within them. Google Web Toolkit (GWT) \u2693\ufe0e Google Web Toolkit (GWT) allows programmers to write client-server applications in Java without worrying about the details of remote procedure calls (RPCs) except for providing explicit callbacks for RPCs (one for a successful call, one for failure).GWT compiles the client code into JavaScript, which runs within a web browser, and the RPCs run as Java code on the server, with communication done via HTTP.The reader is advised to learn about GWT before delving into the portion of App Inventor that runs in, or responds to requests from, the user\u2019s browser. Google App Engine \u2693\ufe0e Google App Engine (GAE) is a cloud-computing platform that enables programs written in Java (or Python) to run and maintain data on Google servers.The original internal version of App Inventor was built directly on proprietary Google infrastructure but, for the open source release, was rewritten to use GAE, using the third-party Objectify datastore API. GWT and GAE play well together, where a GWT server can run on a GAE server. This is how App Inventor works, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Figure 1 The App Inventor client and server are created with GWT, which converts the front-end code into JavaScript, which is run with the GWT client library in the user\u2019s browser.The back-end runs on the GWT server library as a Google App Engine service, using the third-party Objectify API for data storage Android \u2693\ufe0e If you\u2019ve never written an Android application before and if you\u2019re going to work on components, the Hello World tutorial is a good way to get started. If you are serious about writing components, you should also complete the Managing the Activity lifecycle section. Schema & Kawa \u2693\ufe0e Kawa is a free implementation of Scheme that compiles to Java byte code, which can be converted by the tool dx into Dalvik byte code .We use Scheme as the internal representation of users\u2019 programs, and part of the runtime library is written in Scheme.These get compiled down to byte code and linked with our components library (written in Java) and external libraries (written in Java and C/C++) by the build server. Blockly \u2693\ufe0e In App Inventor 2, the blocks editor has been integrated into the browser, as opposed to the Java Web Start application that ships with App Inventor. Blockly is an open source library created by Googler Neil Fraser, and it\u2019s written in JavaScript (using SVG). Project & Directories \u2693\ufe0e The App Inventor distribution consists of the following subdirectories, the first seven of which contain source code for sub-projects: aiphoneapp \u2693\ufe0e The interpreter that runs on the mobile device or emulator when it is connected to a computer running App Inventor. aiplayapp \u2693\ufe0e Another version of the interpreter that runs on the mobile device or emulator when it is connected to a computer running App Inventor. This is what we call the MIT App Inventor Companion. appengine \u2693\ufe0e The GWT application that provides the Designer JavaScript code to the client browser and provides supporting server-side functionality, such as storing and retrieving projects and issuing compile requests to the buildserver. blocklyeditor \u2693\ufe0e The Blocks Editor, embedded in the browser and powered by Blockly. Used by both blockseditor and buildserver. buildserver \u2693\ufe0e An http server/servlet that takes a source zip file as input and produces an apk and/or error messages. common \u2693\ufe0e Constants and utility classes used by other sub-projects. components \u2693\ufe0e Code supporting App Inventor components, including annotations, implementations, and scripts for extracting component information needed by other sub-projects.More information can be found in the documents: - How to Add A Component - How to Add a Property to a Component docs \u2693\ufe0e User-level documentation, such as tutorials. lib \u2693\ufe0e External libraries, such as JUnit, used by the various sub-projects.They are listed below in External Libraries. App Inventor Classic \u2693\ufe0e Component Information \u2693\ufe0e simple_components.json \u2693\ufe0e This file is used by the editor within the Designer in the GWT client (part of the appengine project).Here are the keys, their meanings, and sample values for the AccelerometerSensor. Key Meaning Sample value name the component\u2019s name AccelerometerSensor version a number incremented whenever the component\u2019s API is changed (such as by adding a new Property) 1 categoryString the section on the palette in which it should appear SENSORS helpString descriptive HTML text shown when the user clicks the help icon to the right of the component\u2019s name Non-visible component that can detect shaking and measure acceleration... showOnPalette whether to show the component on the palette (currently true for all components except for Form, which is automatically created) true nonVisible false for GUI elements, true for non-GUI elements, such as sensors true iconName a path to the component\u2019s icon, relative to appinventor/appengine/src/com/google/appinventor images/accelerometersensor.png properties a list containing the name, type, and default value of each property [{ \u201cname\u201d: \u201cEnabled\u201d, \u201ceditorType\u201d: \u201cboolean\u201d, \u201cdefaultValue\u201d: \u201cTrue\u201d}] simple_components.txt \u2693\ufe0e This file, which simply lists component names alphabetically, one per line, is used by the buildserver when building user projects. simple_components_permissions.json \u2693\ufe0e This file, which is used by the buildserver to generate the permissions required by an app, has entries with the names and required permissions of each component, such as: 1 2 3 4 { \"name\" : \"Clock\" , \"permissions\" : []}, { \"name\" : \"ContactPicker\" , \"permissions\" : [ \"android.permission.INTERNET\" , \"android.permission.READ_CONTACTS\" ]} ya_lang_def.xml \u2693\ufe0e This file contains the specification of the blocks used by blockseditor (via blockslib), including both static library functions and components with their methods, properties, and events.Its header and footer come from the static filesOUTPUT_HEADER.txt and OUTPUT_FOOTER.txt in the src/com/google/appinventor/components/scripts/templates directory within the components project.At the time of this writing, ya_lang_def was over 14,000 lines.

StoreValue(text tag, any valueToStore) Store the given value under the given tag.The storage persists on the phone when the app is restarted. External Libraries \u2693\ufe0e A number of external libraries are included in the distribution under the subdirectory appinventor/lib .Listed by directory, the are: Library Name Descriptions android the Android SDK , used within the components project to generate: animal_sniffer Animal Sniffer , used within the blockseditor project\u2019s BlocksEditorTest to ensure that the Blocks Editor does not contain references to any methods added to the Java standard libraries after Java 5 (1.5). (In the past, we had problems with String.isEmpty() sneaking in.) Note that this is for App Inventor classic only. ant-contrib Ant-Contrib , which defines the propertyregex task used within the macro ai.dojunit in build-common.xml. appengine the App Engine Java SDK required by the appengine project. args4j Args4j , a parser for command-line options used for the standalone version of the compiler (which is used to generate StarterApp) within the buildserver project. blockly this is the source code for the Blockly library in which the blocks editor in App Inventor 2 is based. commons-fileupload part of the Apache Commons , providing the ability to upload projects and individual asset files to the UploadServlet within the appengine project. commons-io part of the Apache Commons , providing the FileUtils class, which is used in BlockSaveFileTest.java in the blockslib project. findbugs FindBugs , which is only included for its definition of javax.annotation.Nullable, which is required by the Guava GWT library . gson Gson , a Java library to convert between JSON and Java objects, required by keyczar (below). guava Guava , a public version of some of the internal Google libraries on which the original version of App Inventor was written. gwt Google Web Toolkit , used by appengine to create the browser client. gwt_dragdrop gwt-dnd , a drag-and-drop library for GWT. This is used by appengine as part of the browser client. gwt_incubator the deprecated Google Web Toolkit Incubator . The appengine project uses GWTCanvas andColor in the mock component implementation. jdk5 this includes the API signature file (not library) jdk5.sig to be used by animal_sniffer (above) to ensure that the Blocks Editor does not contain references to any methods added to the Java standard libraries after Java 5 (1.5). This was generated by a commented-out target, BuildJdk5Signature, in the build.xml file for blockseditor. json the reference Java library to parse JSON . JSON is used throughout the system: junit the standard Java unit testing library (JUnit), used for tests throughout the system. junit4 test libraries for Java , used on top of JUnit. junit-addons JUnit addons , specifically the classes junitx.framework.Assert and junitx.framework.ListAssert . kawa the Kawa language framework , whose included compiler is used to convert YAIL/Scheme code to Java byte code. keyczar the Keyczar cryptographic library used for generating keys for signing Android apps. log4j the log4j logging library required by keyczar. objectify-3.0 the objectify-appengine library , which provides a simpler interface to the Google App Engine datastore. powermock the PowerMock testing framework , which enables mocking Android classes with final methods. responder-iq classes supporting testing from the responder-iq library. Specifically, we use the classes com.riq.MockHttpServletRequest and com.riq.MockHttpServletResponse in DownloadServletTest.java. tablelayout TableLayout used in blockslib for layout within the Blocks Editor, not to be confused with the Android TableLayout class. twitter Twitter4j , an unofficial Java library for the Twitter API, used by the Twitter component. Programming Style \u2693\ufe0e We generally follow these style guides: Android Code Style Rules Sun/Oracle Code Conventions Javadoc An exception is that we use upper-camel-case (e.g., MoveTo ) for component property, method, and event names. Git Branches \u2693\ufe0e The official App Inventor sources reside on GitHub in mit-cml/appinventor-sources The primary branches are: master -- The current sources for MIT App Inventor 2 ai1 -- The last version of MIT App Inventor Classic gh-pages -- This website (GitHub convention for pages) ucr -- Upcoming Component Release Periodically there will be other branches for a specified purpose, usually branches representing longer term development, often separately reviewed. Currently there is an \u201capi4\u201d branch where we are working on changes to support a minSdk of 4 (or greater). There are two types of releases that we make on our public service. The more significant release we refer to as a \u201cComponent Release.\u201d A Component release includes changes to components such that App Inventor programmers will need to update their version of the App Inventor Companion and we also need to update the buildservers (which package apps for people) to be able to use the new/modified component(s). Because projects are marked with the version of the components they were built with, once we perform a component release WE CANNOT GO BACK!!! It is also worth noting that Component releases require work on the part of App Inventor Programmers because they have to update the AI2 Companion on their devices and or within their copy of the Android Emulator. Because of the effort and testing required, we tend to avoid having too many component releases too close together. In general we have been doing a Component Release once per month. By comparison \u201cnon component releases\u201d are where we do not update components. For example changes to the App Inventor blocks layer, or other features of the Website itself. They can usually be backed out if there is a problem and they do require action on the part of App Inventor programmers. Because we do not wish to do component releases too often, we do not always want to checking changes to the master branch which contain component changes. Instead we have a new branch named \u201cucr\u201d where we will be merging component changes that pass review. When it comes time to do a Component Release, we will merge the ucr branch into the master branch prior to the release. GitHub and Gerrit Reviews \u2693\ufe0e Changes to MIT App Inventor should be made via the GitHub Workflow . In general we will not use GitHub to merge in changes. Instead after reviewing a change the release coordinators will squash your commits down to a single commit which will either be rebase on the master branch (non component change) or onto the ucr branch (component changes). Often as part of this work we will submit your commit to our private \u201cGerrit\u201d review server which will arrange for automated running of our unit tests via the \u201cJenkins\u201d continuous integration system. In general you do not need to be aware of this level of detail. Sometimes internal changes bypass the GitHub workflow and are reviewed directly on Gerrit, though this is happening less often now.","title":"App Inventor Developer Overview"},{"location":"opensource/overview/#app-inventor-developer-overview","text":"Ellen Spertus (spertus@google.com) Jos\u00e9 Dominguez (josmasflores@gmail.com)","title":"App Inventor Developer Overview"},{"location":"opensource/overview/#introduction","text":"This document provides a high-level overview of the App Inventor source code, including the toolkit and libraries on which App Inventor depends, the different sub-projects within App Inventor, and information flow during the build process and execution.

Currently there is an \u201capi4\u201d branch where we are working on changes to support a minSdk of 4 (or greater). There are two types of releases that we make on our public service. The more significant release we refer to as a \u201cComponent Release.\u201d A Component release includes changes to components such that App Inventor programmers will need to update their version of the App Inventor Companion and we also need to update the buildservers (which package apps for people) to be able to use the new/modified component(s). Because projects are marked with the version of the components they were built with, once we perform a component release WE CANNOT GO BACK!!! It is also worth noting that Component releases require work on the part of App Inventor Programmers because they have to update the AI2 Companion on their devices and or within their copy of the Android Emulator. Because of the effort and testing required, we tend to avoid having too many component releases too close together. In general we have been doing a Component Release once per month. By comparison \u201cnon component releases\u201d are where we do not update components. For example changes to the App Inventor blocks layer, or other features of the Website itself. They can usually be backed out if there is a problem and they do require action on the part of App Inventor programmers. Because we do not wish to do component releases too often, we do not always want to checking changes to the master branch which contain component changes. Instead we have a new branch named \u201cucr\u201d where we will be merging component changes that pass review. When it comes time to do a Component Release, we will merge the ucr branch into the master branch prior to the release.","title":"Git Branches"},{"location":"opensource/overview/#github-and-gerrit-reviews","text":"Changes to MIT App Inventor should be made via the GitHub Workflow . In general we will not use GitHub to merge in changes. Instead after reviewing a change the release coordinators will squash your commits down to a single commit which will either be rebase on the master branch (non component change) or onto the ucr branch (component changes). Often as part of this work we will submit your commit to our private \u201cGerrit\u201d review server which will arrange for automated running of our unit tests via the \u201cJenkins\u201d continuous integration system. In general you do not need to be aware of this level of detail.
