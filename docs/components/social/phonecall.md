# PhoneCall

A non-visible component that makes a phone call to the number specified in the `PhoneNumber` property, which can be set either in the Designer or Blocks Editor. The component has a `MakePhoneCall` method, enabling the program to launch a phone call.

Often, this component is used with the `ContactPicker` component, which lets the user select a contact from the ones stored on the phone and sets the `PhoneNumber` property to the contact's phone number.

To directly specify the phone number (e.g., 650-555-1212), set the `PhoneNumber` property to a Text with the specified digits (e.g., "6505551212"). Dashes, dots, and parentheses may be included (e.g., "(650)-555-1212") but will be ignored; spaces may not be included.
