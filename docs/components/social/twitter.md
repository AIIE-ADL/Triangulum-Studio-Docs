# Twitter

A non-visible component that enables communication with [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com). Once a user has logged into their Twitter account (and the authorization has been confirmed successful by the `IsAuthorized` event), many more operations are available:

*   Searching Twitter for tweets or labels (`SearchTwitter`)
*   Sending a Tweet (`Tweet`)
*   Sending a Tweet with an Image (`TweetWithImage`)
*   Directing a message to a specific user (`DirectMessage`)
*   Receiving the most recent messages directed to the logged-in user (`RequestDirectMessages`)
*   Following a specific user (`Follow`)
*   Ceasing to follow a specific user (`StopFollowing`)
*   Getting a list of users following the logged-in user (`RequestFollowers`)
*   Getting the most recent messages of users followed by the logged-in user (`RequestFriendTimeline`)
*   Getting the most recent mentions of the logged-in user (`RequestMentions`)

You must obtain a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret for Twitter authorization specific to your app from http://twitter.com/oauth\_clients/new
