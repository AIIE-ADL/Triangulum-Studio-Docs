# NearField

Non-visible component to provide NFC capabilities. For now this component supports the reading and writing of text tags only (if supported by the device)

In order to read and write text tags, the component must have its `ReadMode` property set to True or False respectively.

**Note:** This component will only work on Screen1 of any App Inventor app.
