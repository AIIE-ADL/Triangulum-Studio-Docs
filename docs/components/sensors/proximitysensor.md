# ProximitySensor

Non-visible component that can measures the proximity of an object in cm relative to the view screen of a device. This sensor is typically used to determine whether a handset is being held up to a persons ear; i.e. lets you determine how far away an object is from a device. Many devices return the absolute distance, in cm, but some return only near and far values. In this case, the sensor usually reports its maximum range value in the far state and a lesser value in the near state.

## Events

---

### ProximityChanged

<div block-type = "component_event" component-selector = "ProximitySensor" event-selector = "ProximityChanged" id = "proximitysensor-proximitychanged"></div>

Triggered when distance (in cm) of the object to the device changes.

| Param Name | IO Type |
| :--------: | :-----: |
|  distance  |  number |

## Block Properties

---

### Available

<div block-type = "component_set_get" component-selector = "ProximitySensor" property-selector = "Available" property-type = "get" id = "get-proximitysensor-available"></div>

Reports whether or not the device has a proximity sensor.

| Param Name | IO Type |
| :--------: | :-----: |
|  Available | boolean |

### Distance

<div block-type = "component_set_get" component-selector = "ProximitySensor" property-selector = "Distance" property-type = "get" id = "get-proximitysensor-distance"></div>

Returns the distance from the object to the device

| Param Name | IO Type |
| :--------: | :-----: |
|  Distance  |  number |

### Enabled

<div block-type = "component_set_get" component-selector = "ProximitySensor" property-selector = "Enabled" property-type = "get" id = "get-proximitysensor-enabled"></div>

<div block-type = "component_set_get" component-selector = "ProximitySensor" property-selector = "Enabled" property-type = "set" id = "set-proximitysensor-enabled"></div>

If true, the sensor will generate events. Otherwise, no events are generated.

| Param Name | IO Type |
| :--------: | :-----: |
|   Enabled  | boolean |

### KeepRunningWhenOnPause

<div block-type = "component_set_get" component-selector = "ProximitySensor" property-selector = "KeepRunningWhenOnPause" property-type = "get" id = "get-proximitysensor-keeprunningwhenonpause"></div>

<div block-type = "component_set_get" component-selector = "ProximitySensor" property-selector = "KeepRunningWhenOnPause" property-type = "set" id = "set-proximitysensor-keeprunningwhenonpause"></div>

Returns value of keepRunningWhenOnPause

|       Param Name       | IO Type |
| :--------------------: | :-----: |
| KeepRunningWhenOnPause | boolean |

### MaximumRange

<div block-type = "component_set_get" component-selector = "ProximitySensor" property-selector = "MaximumRange" property-type = "get" id = "get-proximitysensor-maximumrange"></div>

Reports the Maximum Range of the device's ProximitySensor

|  Param Name  | IO Type |
| :----------: | :-----: |
| MaximumRange |  number |
