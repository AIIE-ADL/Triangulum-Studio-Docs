# Sound

A multimedia component that plays sound files and optionally vibrates for the number of milliseconds (thousandths of a second) specified in the Blocks Editor. The name of the sound file to play can be specified either in the Designer or in the Blocks Editor.

For supported sound file formats, see [Android Supported Media Formats](http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html).

This `Sound` component is best for short sound files, such as sound effects, while the `Player` component is more efficient for longer sounds, such as songs.

You might get an error if you attempt to play a sound immeditely after setting the source.
