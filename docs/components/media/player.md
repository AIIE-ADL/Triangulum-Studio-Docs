# Player

Multimedia component that plays audio and controls phone vibration. The name of a multimedia field is specified in the `Source` property, which can be set in the Designer or in the Blocks Editor. The length of time for a vibration is specified in the Blocks Editor in milliseconds (thousandths of a second).

For supported audio formats, see [Android Supported Media Formats](http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html).

This component is best for long sound files, such as songs, while the `Sound` component is more efficient for short files, such as sound effects.
